# server_side_apis_project_weather_dashboard

**Description**
This project involves building a weather dashboard "that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS". JavaScript was used for the scripting and logical expression of the API dataset obtained from the Open Weather Map Website.

**Motivation for the project**
I faced an initial challenge completing the project, but I was able to resolve the bottleneck and I was highly motivated to complete the project. I was curious to know how I can use a third party and a server-side API to create a Weather Forecast. I am glad to learn the inner workings of API and how I can leverage the API in my project as a developer.

**What problem does it solve?**
The weather dashboard helps a user plan their itinerary accurately for the current day as well as provides them with a weather forecast for the next 5 days. It also helps a farmer to plan their farming events correctly as well as manage their resources effectively and efficiently. For example, a farmer will probably save time, water, and electricity or gas if they are aware in advance that it will rain for the next 2 days.

**Usage**

The main objective of this project is for the user to leverage the 5 Day Weather Dashboard to retrieve weather data like Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed for their respective cities.

A user starts by entering a city into the "Search for a City" text box at the top left side of the screen then clicking on the Search button. The current weather data for the searched city is displayed on the screen as well as a 5-Day weather forecast data.
The text input in the "Search for a city" textbox defaults to the last city searched by the user. If the user removes the last city searched, the text box defaults to a placeholder (Enter your city here).
